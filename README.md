# Hi, My Name is Joanna

I'm currently a student at Lexicon, and this is an assignment from my program. I have studied some basic JavaScript prior to this. This time around, I wanted to get a more fundamental understanding of the code to write more independently and effectively. So my code might not follow best practices but supports my understanding of the concepts. As I did in my earlier JavaScript projects, I wrote and rewrote parts of the code multiple times to get more experience and remember what to write by hand. After completing this project, I feel more confident about conquering JavaScript.

## Challenges

My biggest challenge in this project was choosing an API that matched my understanding of the code. The process of selecting the API took much longer than writing the code.
 
## Mindset Change

One thing that usually works for me is taking a break. Eventually, I decided to approach this project from a different angle. I watched a few YouTube videos that recommended different APIs. Since I'm interested in projects that help or entertain users in different ways, I decided to test two APIs and choose the one that would take the least amount of time. One was [Adviceslip API](https://api.adviceslip.com), and the other was a Sudoku API. I chose to create an Advice generator.

## Functionality

I used local storage and CRUD functionality. I used a fetch function to get the API data. The page displays a card, where users can either get new advice or save an advice to a dynamic list.

## UI

In the end, I chose to use the UI elements from a previous project.

## If I Had More Time...

- Make the project responsive and improve accessibility.
- Create a routine to systematically search for errors.

## What I Learned

- DOM manipulation
- Local storage
- Most importantly...

I have learned to appreciate the results I can see in the DOM. By watching different people coding on YouTube, I realized that instead of viewing the results in the DOM, they view the results in the console. Instead of striving for the end result, they create one element or function at a time. This will definitely reduce my frustration and the number of different JavaScript files I create.

## If I Would Create This Project from Scratch

- Choose a simple API and ask for help if I get stuck choosing.
- Create a minimum viable product (MVP).
- Work on one element or function at a time (read: more patience).
- Use console.log meticulously.
- Create an approximate timeframe for different parts of the project.
